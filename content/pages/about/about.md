Slug: about

As a Phd in Earth, Energy and Environmental Sciences, I am working as a Geoscientist in an interdisciplinary team providing consulting services to the oil and gas industry worldwide. My experience includes consulting projects, R & D for geomodeling algorithms in major oil companies, uncertainty quantification for petroleum reservoirs, geographic information sciences, and data analytics. I am also an active contributor to the open source data science and artificial intelligence community in my personal life. All views expressed by me on this blog only represent my personal interests and have nothing to do with anyone else including my employer.
