Title: About Me
Slug: about

As a Phd in Earth, Energy and Environmental Sciences, I am working as a Geoscientist/Static Modeler in an interdisciplinary team providing consulting services to the oil and gas industry worldwide. My experience includes consulting projects, R & D for geomodeling algorithms in major oil companies, uncertainty quantification for petroleum reservoirs, geographic information sciences, and data analytics. Besides earth sciences and energy industry, I am interested in data science and artificial intelligence in my personal life, and searching opportunities of applying these techniques to problems in earth sciences and the energy industry. In this blog, I post and share my learning experiences and excercises.
